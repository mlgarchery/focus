**Focus** is an Android app designed to help you regain control over your screen time, with a specific focus on reducing endless scrolling on YouTube Shorts.

It securely runs on-device to monitor when YouTube Shorts or Vivaldi browser is opened, tracks how long you spend watching short-form videos, and gently but firmly blocks access once your personal limits are reached. By using official Android accessibility features (with full user consent), Focus provides real-time intervention without collecting or sharing any personal data.

The goal is simple: **turn mindless scrolling into mindful usage** and help you stay focused on what actually matters.
