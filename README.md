# Block Shorts everywhere they are

If a short is detected for 5 seconds straight, the phone is blocked: you have to wait a delay for the blocking overlay to disappear and to be able to use your phone again and FOCUS on something else than trash content.

**Works accross multiple apps**

- chrome, vivaldi, firefox : working
- youtube app: working
- telegram in-app browser: seem to work as well !

## Installation

This app requires high privileged permissions to function.

![Download APK](imgs/image.png)
Download APK file, put it on your phone and install it. Google will display a warning and ask you to scan it, continue with installation without scan.

Then once you launch the app you have two buttons directing you to the permissions to accept:

1. Permission to read the screen
   ![First permission, read screen](imgs/Screenshot_20260201_184050_Settings.jpg)

2. Permission to display overlay on top of other app
   ![Second permission, allow overlay](imgs/Screenshot_20260201_184125_Settings.jpg)

The detection can be improved, _for sure_.
